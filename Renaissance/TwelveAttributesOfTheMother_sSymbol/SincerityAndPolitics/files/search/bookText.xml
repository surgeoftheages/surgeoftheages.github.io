                  THE ATTITUDE OF A TRUE POLITICIAN?



                  If one were a man who did not accept any



                 kind of compromise, one could not remain


                       in politics; one would quite simply be


                     pushed out by the very force of things.




                                  There will be a time when all



                                  this will change, but not yet.
















                                                                                     bharatshakti.aurosociety.org]]></page><page Index="3"><![CDATA[Politics is perhaps the last




                               thing which will change.



                                  There are many others





                           which must change before.




                                It is certainly one of the




                              most recalcitrant things.

                           is very difficult to change:




                            FINANCE AND POLITICS;




                         the field of money and the field



                                 of government are the two



                              points where man is weakest


                        and most attached to falsehood.




                           So, probably, transformation



                                will come there last of all.

                   transformation, an economic




                   transformation, a transformation




                   of education; one can hope for



                   all this long before the




                   transformation of politics



                   and of finance. ...

                      transformed will be the scientific




                    world, it is possible; because there




                       a very great sincerity is required




                           and a very persevering effort,



                          and these already are qualities




                                     which open for you the




                                       door to a higher life. . .

                                        — to be an organiser



                 (it’s not “to govern,” it’s to organise)




                  — the conditions to be an organiser



                                              should be these:



                                              no more desires,



                                       no more preferences,

                                          no more repulsions



                     — a perfect equality for all things.
